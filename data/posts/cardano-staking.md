Many recommend using **Ledger Hardware Wallet** to hold your cryptocurrency, and so far I have found it is well worth the money.

Pros:

- Keeps your private keys secure
- Allows easy backup
- Compatible with most cryptocurrencies
- Easy Setup

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.
